I got this code from the net, I believe from a Google search. At this
point I unfortunately can't remember where. Fortunately it is sufficiently
generic and the Python internal interfaces sufficiently stable that it has
gracefully made the transition from Python 1.5.2 to Python 2.3.3 without
any changes at all.
